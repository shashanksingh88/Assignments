**Task:**  
Write a loop to print even numbers from 1–20.  

**Outcome:**  
You’ll control the program’s flow logically.  

**Future Goal:**  
Apply loops in arrays, collections, and file processing.  

---

You’ll know how to store, access, and modify multiple values efficiently.  

**Future Goal:**  
Learn about `ArrayList` and dynamic collections.  

---

## ✍️ 6. String Handling  

**Explanation:**  
Strings in Java are immutable; you can manipulate them using `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`.  

**Task:**  
Write a program that counts vowels in a string.  

**Outcome:**  
Understand string operations, concatenation, and mutability.  

**Future Goal:**  
Work on file text parsing and input validation.  

---

## 🧠 7. Methods  

**Explanation:**  
Methods perform specific tasks. Includes **overloading** (same name, different parameters) and **recursion** (method calling itself).  

**Task:**  
Create a recursive method to find factorial of a number.  

**Outcome:**  
You’ll design reusable and modular code.  

**Future Goal:**  
Implement functions in real projects to reduce redundancy.  

---

## 🏗️ 8. Classes & Objects  

**Explanation:**  
A class is a blueprint; an object is its instance.  

**Task:**  
Create a class `Student` with fields `name` and `rollNo`, and display them.  

**Outcome:**  
Understand how real-world entities are represented in code.  

**Future Goal:**  
Combine multiple classes to build full systems.  

---

## 🔐 9. Encapsulation  

**Explanation:**  
Binding data using access modifiers and providing access via getters and setters.  

**Task:**  
Make `Student` fields private and access them using methods.  

**Outcome:**  
Learn how to protect and control data.  

**Future Goal:**  
Implement secure class designs in applications.
